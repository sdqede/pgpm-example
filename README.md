## Verify `.sql` watch (module1)

```sh
# Install dependencies (repo root)
pnpm install

# Run Jest in watch mode (uses your Docker Postgres on localhost:5432)
PGHOST=localhost PGPORT=5432 PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password pnpm -C packages/module1 test:watch -- __tests__/basic.test.ts
```

Then edit and save `packages/module1/__tests__/watch.sql` (e.g. change `SELECT 1 AS num;` → `SELECT 2 AS num;`). Jest should rerun automatically; change it back to make the test pass again.

## Getting Started

This workspace was generated with `pgpm init workspace`. For a complete guide on developing with pgpm workspaces, see [Workspaces: Organize Postgres](https://launchql.com/learn/modular-postgres/workspaces-organize-postgres).

### Quick Start

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start PostgreSQL (requires Docker)
pgpm docker start

# Load environment variables
eval "$(pgpm env)"

# Create a module
pgpm init

# Navigate to your module and run tests
cd packages/your-module
pnpm test:watch
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- Docker
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`)
- pgpm (`npm install -g pgpm`)

See [Prerequisites](https://launchql.com/learn/quickstart/prerequisites) for detailed setup instructions.
